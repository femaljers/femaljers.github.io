          I am Frédérique Maljers and I am currently a student at Laar en Berg in the Netherlands.
          I was born in the Netherlands, and I also went to a Dutch school for all my live except highschool.
          I have recently got my degree for a four year bilingual program at my highschool and right now in my 5th year of highschool,
          I am still contiuing with studying English at a high level. The bilingual program was a program in both Dutch and English and I am
          almost fluent at both languages and at the same level as, for example American students. I also am doing a double profile nature,
           which in the Netherlands means that I study physics, Biology, Advanced Mathematics and Chemistry. But I am also interested in other subjects
           like Film (which I also study in English), arts and informatica (the reason why I am currently making this website).<p>
